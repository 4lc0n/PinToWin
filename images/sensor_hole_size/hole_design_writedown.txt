R1 = LDR

R2 = 2k

ambient light: 630 lx

19 to 15: too dark

1: works
1 all the way up: base level is much higher, amplitude difference more clear


5: works also but with two light sources: two steps of darkening
5: all the way up: not that precise, small detection radius



10: base level low, on dark: 0.5

12: ambient light might work, as it tunnels the shade



14: works, on dark: 0.5, but very dependent on angle
minimum reached when at 30-40% passed
