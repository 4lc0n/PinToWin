timing of tasks: 

		Execution time	Free time	Prio
ADC task: 	1000 us		1750 (1000)	1
Solenoid task	1 ... 60 us	(5000)		1
Score task	1 us		100 000		1
Safety task	21 us		1750 (1000)	3
	


NOTE: 

- safety task fails when some sprintf is involved: maybe memory leak somehow?
- after removing sprintf works, also with pring_debug

- moved print_debug to UART1

- TODO: change tick count to 32 bit

- TODO: implement recognition for LDR sensor
